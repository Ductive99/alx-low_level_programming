# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array, also called a dictionary, which maps keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, or hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be retrieved. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.
