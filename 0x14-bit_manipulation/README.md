# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation
Bit manipulation allows us to directly control and modify individual bits within variables using bitwise operators, 
providing efficient solutions for tasks like setting flags, performing bitwise operations, and compactly representing data.
## Bitwise Operators:
1. Bitwise AND Operator (&)
2. Bitwise OR  Operator (|)
3. Bitwise XOR Operator (^)
4. Bitwise NOT Operator (~)
5. Left-Shift  (<<)
6. Right-Shift (>>)
